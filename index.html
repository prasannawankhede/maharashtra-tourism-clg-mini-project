					Nanded is an old and historic centre.[5] Local irrigation practices and Nanded itself are recorded in the treatise, Leela Charitra (late 1200s CE).[6] It is also mentioned in Mahabharata as place of Bharat's maternal grandparents

In the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, Nanded was ruled by the Nanda dynasty. In the 3rd century BCE (about 272 to 231 BCE), it was part of the Maurya Empire under Ashoka.

In the 1st century CE, power in the area lay with the Andhrabhrtyas and Satvahanas.[5]

From 1636, Nanded was the centre of governance of Nizam State, which includes present-day Telangana and Karnataka, and was an imperial province of the Mughal Badshah (emperor) Shah Jahan. In 1657, Nanded merged into Bidah Subah.
